# Thymleaf-Jsp
Project for having multiple view technology.<br/>
This is a sample project which include two view resolvers (Thymeleaf and JSP).<br/>
You can make use of this sample project in your application, <br/>
if your application/product has a requirement to work with more than one view resolver.<br/><br/><br/>
<b>Important to note:</b><br/>
Its just the folder structure how you design and specify it in the resolver.<br/>
And to be safer your resolver can have a property "viewnames" through this<br/>
the resolver check whether the view should be resolved from it or pass on to the next resolver.<br/>
You can also specify the priority for the resolver which resolver should be choosen first by having a property "order".<br/>
